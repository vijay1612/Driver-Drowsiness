# Driver-Drowsiness- Detection
# The files and outputs(Accuracy), you can find in Master Branch.
Here are the basic doucments for my project according to this give me an read me file to add in my github and later give me an, 
req.txt file also and give me more technical stuff in my read me ffike.
# Driver Drowsiness Detection

## Overview
The Driver Drowsiness Detection project aims to create an intelligent system that detects when a driver is drowsy. This can be extremely useful in reducing accidents caused by driver fatigue. The system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect facial features and eye states, alerting the driver if they are falling asleep or showing signs of fatigue.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Drowsiness Detection**: The system can continuously monitor the driver's face and provide real-time alerts if drowsiness is detected.
- **Eye Aspect Ratio Calculation**: The system calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect if the eyes are closed for a prolonged period.
- **Video Input**: The system can use a video feed (e.g., from a webcam or a recorded video) to monitor the driver.
- **Alerts**: If drowsiness is detected, an alert is triggered (e.g., sound alarm or visual warning).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for this project.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for computer vision tasks, used for image processing and real-time video feed handling.
- **Dlib**: A toolkit for machine learning and computer vision that helps detect facial landmarks.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building and training any additional machine learning models if required.
- **scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Used for visualizing results such as data analysis, model performance, etc.
